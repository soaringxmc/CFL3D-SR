<p><a NAME="split"><strong><u>BLOCK AND INPUT FILE SPLITTING</u></strong>

<p>IF A LIMITER IS DESIRED, USE IFLIM=4. This will allow for consistent
results with block splitting; iflim=3 is not recommended - iflim=4 is
basically a correct implementation of iflim=3 for multiple blocks, and
should now be viewed as the recommended limiter for any case that needs one.

<p>Also, for exact consistency between split and unsplit grids, version 5
emulation (i.e. "Install -v5) should not be used. Version 5  (and earlier
versions) made an approximation for cell volumes at 1-1 block interfaces
that has been eliminated in version 6 in favor of the exact treatment.

<p>The input file part of the splitter works by first converting the
unsplit CFL3D input file to a TLNS3D map file, splitting the
TLNS3D map file, then converting the split TLNS3D map file back
to a CFL3D input file.

<p>Caveats: The conversions from the CFL3D input file to a TLNS3D
            map file are not perfect! The user is urged check the
              resulting split CFL3D input (and patch) files. A useful
              check before actually splitting the files is to run this
              splitter with the number of splittings = 0, and the
              output grid file as null. This will cause to code to go
              through the translations, but the "split" files will
              have the same numbers of blocks, and the "split" grid
              will not be output. A "diff" or "gdiff" will point
              to translation-induced differences that should be
              easier to sort out than when coupled with true splitting.
              Note that the 2-step process almost always results in a
              *reordering* of some boundary condition segments.

<p><strong>Sample splitter input file:</strong>
<p>This example splits block 1 in half in the i-direction, then splits each
of the two resulting blocks in half in the j-direction; i.e. block 1 is
split into 4 eqidimensioned blocks.

</dl>

<p>Following the value of nsplits, nsplits triplets of integers
must appear, one integer of the triplet per line:

<dl>
<p><strong><dt>iblk</dt></strong>
  <dd>block number of the block to be split. NOTE: iblk
      always refers to the original, unsplit block number</dd>

<p><strong><dt>ldir</dt></strong>
  <dd>= 1 split in the i-direction</dd>
  <dd>= 2 split in the j-direction</dd>
  <dd>= 3 split in the k-direction</dd>

<p><strong><dt>index</dt></strong>
  <dd>split the block in the ldir direction at this value
      of the index</dd>
  <dd>NOTE: use 0 for a quick way to split at the midpoint
      of the ldir direction...HOWEVER: if you want to do
      multiple splits in a particular coordinate direction,
      then the 0 index shortcut cannot be used.</dd>
  <dd>for example, if block 6 has 129 points in say, the i-direction,
      and it is desired to split the block into 4 pieces in the
      i-direction (3 splits), then one must use:
  </dl>
   <p><dd>NSPLITS</dd>
      <dd>3</dd>
      <dd>6</dd>
      <dd>1</dd>
      <dd>33</dd>
      <dd>6</dd>
      <dd>1</dd>
      <dd>65</dd>
      <dd>6</dd>
      <dd>1</dd>
      <dd>97</dd>
</dl>

<p>The 0 index shortcut could still be used in the j
       and/or k directions provided there is only one split in
       block 6 in either the j and/or k directions.</p>

<p>For sensitivity (derivative) evaluation, CFL3Dv6 uses complex variables.
For geometrical derivatives, this requires that the grid be complex-valued.
To split a complex-valued grid, use SPLITTERCMPLX rather than SPLITTER. All
the information above holds for the complex case, except that now both the
split and unsplit grids are complex-valued.</p>

<p><strong>ALWAYS check your output file from the CFL3D
run for any evidence of "geometric mismatch" (i.e., look for this
phrase in the flow solver output file)!  If this phrase is found, it may
indicate incorrect 1-to-1 connectivity information in the input file.

<p><a NAME="convert"><strong><u>FILE CONVERSION</u></strong>

<p>The splitter may also be used to convert files from formatted to
formatted and vice versa, and from one cfl3d input file type to another.

<p>For example, to convert the formatted grid file grid.fmt to the
unformatted grid file grid.unf and at the same time convert the version 4
input file   cfl3d.inp_v4 to a version 5/6 input file cfl3d.inp_v6:</p>

<p><a NAME="install"></a><strong><u>INSTALLATION</u></strong>

<p>To install CFL3v6 on a particular machine, you must first get it from:
<ul>

 <li type=circle><a href="https://github.com/NASA/CFL3D" target="blank">https://github.com/NASA/CFL3D</a>
</ul>

<!--<p>Make sure that:
<ul>
 <li type=circle>./ is in your path; if not, you will have to explicitly prepend ./ to
all the commands below</ul>-->

<p><strong>STEP 1)</strong>

<p>You should have the
following directory structure:</p>
<pre>
<strong>
                            cfl3d directory structure:

                                 top directory
                                      |

</pre>

<p>The source directory and its associated
subdirectories hold the source code for CFL3D and its supporting codes. The
build directory is used to create execuatbles from the code in the source
directories. Some pieces of source code get copied into the build
directories, while other pieces of source code get soft-linked to the build
directories. Thus,  source code appears visible in the build directories;
however, if the user desires to make any permanent changes to the source
code, the changes need to be made an the source code directory level, not
the build directory level.

<p>Next, cd to the build directory.
Make sure the script file Install has execute permission.

<p><strong>STEP 2)</strong>

<p><span style="color: maroon"><strong>NOTE: the Install script is very old, and may or may not create a workable
makefile for your particular machine.  Also, CFL3D has mostly been used on
Linux-type machines; there is no option for compiling on a Windows machine.</strong></span>

<p>Type:

   <dd><strong>Install [options]</strong></dd>

<p>Where [options] may be one or more of the following:

<dl>
<p><dt>-no_opt
  <dd>create  executables with little optimization but fast compilation
<p><dt>-single
  <dd>create single precision executables
<p><dt>-noredirect
  <dd>disallow redirected input file; often needed for SP2 and
      for Linux with MPI (<strong>generally recommended for MPI</strong> - see note below)
<p><dt>-mpichdir=<em>dir1</em>
  <dd>use MPICH on a workstation cluster; <em>dir1</em> is the directory
      where mpich is located - not used on MPP machines
<p><dt>-purify
  <dd>fortran memory checker: need 3rd party license for this
<p><dt>-fastio
  <dd>fast I/O option when using MPI: creates <strong>cfl3d.out.reass</strong> file 
      (in place of standard output file)... this option may help speed up some
      very large MPI runs by writing output to local files then reassembling
      at the end, rather than sending the output back to the master for
      writing-on-the-fly (acknowledgment: Robert Bergeron, NASA Ames)
<p><dt>-cgnsdir=<em>dir2</em>
  <dd>allow the use of CGNS files instead of the standard
      grid/restart files; <em>dir2</em> is the directory where
      the CGNS libraries are located; the directory should contain the file
      cgnslib_f.h as well as the subdirectory appropriate to the system you are running
      on (for example subdirectory LINUX/) with the library file libcgns.a in it
<p><dt>-linux_compiler_flags=<em>flag</em>
  <dd>sets up to compile using special compiler flags for use on Linux
      operating systems only; <em>flag</em> is currently Intel, PG, Lahey, or Alpha
      (Intel is currently the default)
<p><dt>-help
  <dd>print out the Install options

</dl>

<p>Note: the directory paths for either the mpichdir or cgnsdir options 
should be either absolute paths or paths relative to the installation
directory; the use of ~ to denote a home directory is not allowed.

<ul>
<p><li type=circle>If -no_opt is not specified, various compiler optimization levels are
used to speed execution but results in slower compilation.</li>
 
<p><li type=circle>If -mpichdir=dir1 is not used, then it is assumed "native" MPI is
available, and will use a default  location for the necessary MPI
libraries.</li>

<p><li type=circle>If -single is not used, then double precision exectables will be
created at the make [   ] command.</li>

<p><li type=circle>If -noredirect is not used, then input file redirection will be
allowed, i.e. you can use:
  <strong>cfl3d_seq < </strong> <strong> filename.inp</strong>
to tell CFL3D to use the input data in the
file filename.inp. Otherwise, with the -noredirect option invoked, the input file <strong>must</strong> be named
<strong>cfl3d.inp</strong> when running the code. Unfortunately, the SP2 and many Linux systems cannot
deal with file redirection in many cases when MPI is used, so the -noredirect
option needs to be added. <strong> Our current recommendation is: on the SP2 and on Linux
systems, always install with -noredirect when using MPI,
always name the input file cfl3d.inp, and never use file redirection
(just type the executable name).</strong></li>

<p><li type=circle>If -cgnsdir=dir2 is used, then you must download
the free CGNS system from
(<a href="http://www.CGNS.org">CGNS Home Page</a>).  Compile CGNS
according to the instructions.
Using a CGNS file requires that the CFL3D input
file contain the keyword <strong>icgns 1</strong> 
(see <a href="http://cfl3dv6_new.html"> New Features</a>) in addition to
having installed the code with the -cgnsdir option. It is the user's
responsibility to download the CGNS software from the CGNS website and
insure it is installed correctly in the user-specified directory dir2.
NOTE: while you are free to specify the name of the directory dir2,
please note that the CFL3D Install file makes the following assumptions
about this directory: 1) that it contains a file called cgnslib_f.h and
2) that it contains a subdirectory with a specific name assigned by
CGNS for your particular system, in which is located the file libcgns.a.
Please insure that the subdirectory assigned by the CFL3D Install file
matches the name of the subdirectory created by CGNS for your particular system.
Also NOTE: if you would like to use CGNS but do not have a CGNS grid
available, you can create one using the program plot3dg_to_cgns in the
Tools/ directory (compiled using <strong>make cfl3d_tools</strong>).
</li>

<p><li type=circle>NOTE FOR LINUX USERS: due to the variability of 
Linux installations, available compilers, etc., it is not possible to
set FFLAGS, FTN, etc varables universally once Linux has been identified 
as the OS: the default flags are currently set for the Intel compiler.
Note the default Fortran compiler for Linux is currently set
as mpif77 - if this does not work, you will need to change this
to a compiler that is available on your machine: 
e.g. ifc, pgf90, etc.  For certain implementations of MPI on Linux you may 
need to use the -noredirect install option to turn off input file 
redirection.</li>

<p><li type=circle>A known problem exists for MPI on alphas using myrinet.
The following 2 lines of code in main.F cause an error:
<pre>
sysfile = 'rm -f stop'
call system(sysfile)
</pre>
If you are running under these circumstances, you will need to comment out
these 2 lines of code, and manually delete the "stop" file if it exists.
prior to your run.</li>
</ul>

<p>Standard installation on all MPPs (except for the SP2), Cray C90, and
stand-alone workstations would simply be:

<dl>
  <dd><strong>Install</strong></dd>
</dl>

<p>This  will create a makefile set up for optimized compilation, 
double precision,
using native MPI libraries when needed. <strong>Note: the install script assumes some
very basic locations for the MPI directories - you may need to alter these for
your own particular system</strong>.

<p>Standard installation on a Linux machine with Intel compiler would be:

<dl>
   <dd><strong>Install -noredirect -linux_compiler_flags=Intel</strong></dd>
</dl>

<!--<p>This  will create a makefile set up for optimzed compilation,
double precision,
using the MPI routines contained in the MPICH libraries when needed.
-->


<p>The Install script works by querying the current machine for its
achitecture,
then sets up the various compilation flags based on the architecture, and
creates a file called makefile by edititing the Makefile.in file and inserting
the proper compiler flags. This eliminates the need for multiple makefiles
that are typical of other versions of CFL3D.


<p>At this point CFL3Dv6 has been installed on your machine and you should have
a makefile suited to the particular machine on which you are running.  At
the end of the install script, several messages are written out, indicating
which platform it thinks you are using, where it assumes the mpi directories
are, etc. The  script will also suggest you type make to see  a description
of the various make options. The next  step is to build the executables you
want <a href="cfl3dv6_build.html">Building Executables</a>.</p>

<!--<hr>


<p><a NAME="alias"></a><strong><u>SOME SUGGESTED ALIASES</u></strong>

<p>Once you have CFL3Dv6 installed on your machine, you may want to make
an alias
to the build directory, since compilation of the various executables will
always be done in that directory. If you tend to edit the source code
frequently, you may want to make a similar alias to the source directory.
Such aliases will relieve you from having to type or remember the whole path.
Some examples include:</p>

<dl>
  <dd>alias build "cd ~myhome/cfl3dv6/build"</dd>
  <dd>alias code  "cd ~myhome/cfl3dv6/source/cfl3d/dist"</dd>
</dl>

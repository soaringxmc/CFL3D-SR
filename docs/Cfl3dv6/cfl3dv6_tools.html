<p>
Currently, the following tools are available along with CFL3D.  These files
are all compiled using the <strong>make cfl3d_tools</strong> command (see "Building 
Executables" on the index bar at the left of the CFL3D webpage).
</p>
<ul>
  <li type=circle>Tools:</li>
    <p>
    <dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Get_FD.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program reads two CFL3D restart files and calculate finite
              differences of force and moment coefficients; it is used to validate
              complex-variable approach for determining solution derivatives. </dd>
      <dt><strong>INGRID_to_p3d.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program converts PEGSUS 4.x INGRID file to a PLOT3D file that
              can be used in CFL3D. Note that the INGRID file must correspond
              to grid points rather than "augmented" cell centers. </dd>
      <dt><strong>XINTOUT_to_ovrlp.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program converts the XINTOUT overset grid interpolation file
              from PEGSUS to the <strong>ovrlp.bin</strong> file used by CFL3D. </dd>
      <dt><strong>cfl3d_to_pegbc.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program creates a <strong>peg.bc.raw</strong> file for use with PEGSUS 5.x. </dd>
      <dt><strong>cgns_to_cfl3dinput.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program reads a CGNS file and creates a PLOT3D-type grid as well
              as a best-guess for a CFL3D input file.</dd>
      <dt><strong>everyother_xyz.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program reads a grid and creates an every-other-point grid.  This
              can be useful in combination with the program v6inpdoubhalf.F, in order
              to reduce the required CFL3D run-time memory when you are only
              running on a coarser-level grid (and not taking it up to the finer
              level(s).</dd> 
      <dt><strong>grid_perturb.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program generates a real-valued grid (PLOT3D multiblock form)
              by reading in a real-valued grid (PLOT3D multiblock form) and a
              corresponding real-valued matrix of grid-sensitivity derivatives
              (PLOT3D multiblock function file form, with 3*ndv variables for
              the x,y,z components of the ndv design variables).  The code
              Get_FD.F may be used with the two restart files to determine
              d(Cl)/d(DV), d(Cd)/d(DV), etc. </dd>
      <dt><strong>grid_perturb_cmplx.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program generates a complex-valued grid (PLOT3D multiblock form)
              by reading in a real-valued grid (PLOT3D multiblock form) and a
              corresponding real-valued matrix of grid-sensitivity derivatives
              (PLOT3D multiblock function file form, with 3*ndv variables for
              the x,y,z components of the ndv design variables).  
              The output grid may be read into the complex version of CFL3D
              (cfl3dcmplx_mpi or cfl3dcmplx_seq) to determine the solution
              derivatives with respect to the chosen design variable. </dd>
      <dt><strong>initialize_field.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program creates a <strong>restart.bin</strong> restart file in which you can
              specify specific initial conditions, region by region.  This can
              be useful when "freestream everywhere" is not a desirable initial
              condition.</dd>
      <dt><strong>moovmaker.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program reads the PLOT3D files output by CFL3D when the <strong>MOVIE</strong>
              parameter is used for 2-D datasets (or 3-D datasets surface-only), 
              and creates new PLOT3D files with time as the third (k) direction.</dd>
      <dt><strong>p3d_to_INGRID.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program converts either PLOT3D or CFL3D type grids into either
              INGRID type grids that can be used with PEGSUS 4.x, or PLOT3D
              type grids that can be used with PEGSUS 5.x. The converted grids
              can contain either the grid points as given in the input grids,
              or "augmented" cell centers of the input grids. </dd>
      <dt><strong>p3d_to_cfl3drst.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program reads PLOT3D files and creates an approximate <strong>restart.bin</strong>
              restart file.  This can be useful if: (1) you are given a PLOT3D Q-file
              from another code, and you wish to use it as a basis for starting
              CFL3D, or (2) you have lost the CFL3D restart file, but you still
              have the PLOT3D Q-file.</dd>
      <dt><strong>plot3dg_to_cgns.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program reads a PLOT3D grid file and a CFL3D input file and
              creates a CGNS file (with grid, BC, and 1-to-1 connectivity information
              in it).</dd>
      <dt><strong>v6_restart_mod.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program reads a <strong>restart.bin</strong> restart file and manipulates it.  It can
              switch between unformatted and formatted (which is useful if you need
              to transfer the restart file to a machine of different architecture).
              It can also write out the restart file either the same size, half the size,
              or double the size.  Going to half size is useful if one wishes to restart
              from a fine grid solution and run on a coarser level.  User can choose 
              to coarsen/refine only particular index directions, if desired.  
              The program cannot both coarsen and refine different directions 
              simultaneously.</dd>
      <dt><strong>v6inpdoubhalf.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program reads a CFL3D input file and creates a new input file
              appropriate for a grid of either half or double the size.
              This can be useful in combination with the program everyother_xyz.F when
              running on coarser grid levels, and you wish to reduce the run-time memory
              required.</dd>
      <dt><strong>cgns_readhist.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program reads the convergence history information (residual, CL, CD, etc.)
              from a CGNS file and writes it to a formatted file.</dd>
      <dt><strong>cfl3d_to_nmf.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program reads a CFL3D input file and translates the BC and 1-to-1 information
              to a neutral map file (nmf) format - see 
              http://geolab.larc.nasa.gov/Volume/Doc/nmf.htm
              (available only <em>after</em> Version 6.5).</dd>
      <dt><strong>nmf_to_cfl3dinput.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program reads a neutral map file (nmf) and creates a best-guess for a 
              CFL3D input file.  See
              http://geolab.larc.nasa.gov/Volume/Doc/nmf.htm
              (available only <em>after</em> Version 6.5).</dd>
      <dt><strong>cfl3dinp_to_FVBND.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program reads a CFL3D input file and creates a Fieldview
              .fvbnd file (useful for finding and plotting viscous/inviscid walls).
              (available only <em>after</em> Version 6.5).</dd>
      <dt><strong>gridswitchijk.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> Reads a PLOT3D grid and switches j,k,i to i,j,k (also transposes y and z if desired).
              This is typically helpful if you have a 2-plane grid with
              k as the 2-D direction (CFL3D wants it to be i).
              (available only <em>after</em> Version 6.6).</dd>
      <dt><strong>v6inpswitchijk.F</strong></dt>
         <dd> This program reads a CFL3D V6 input file and outputs another input
              file that transposes i to j, j to k, and k to i.
              This is typically helpful if you have a 2-plane case with
              k as the 2-D direction (CFL3D wants it to be i), and you used an
              automatic tool such as cgns_to_cfl3dinput to create an input file
              from the k-as-2D-direction initial case.
              (available only <em>after</em> Version 6.6).</dd>

<p><a NAME="what"><u><strong>WHAT IS CGNS?</strong></u>

<p>CGNS, which stands for "CFD General Notation
System," was originally developed in the mid-1990's as a joint
effort between Boeing, MDC, and NASA.  
It is an effort to <em>standardize</em>
CFD input and output, including grid, flow solution,
connectivity, BC's, and auxiliary information (in much the
same way that the PLOT3D-format has become the de-facto
standard for grids and flow solutions).  CGNS also allows
for file-stamping and user-inserted-commenting.  It employs
either ADF (Advanced Data Format) from Boeing or HDF-5 from NCSA, two systems 
which create unformatted
files that are portable across computer platforms.

<p><a NAME="why"><u><strong>WHY CGNS?</strong></u>

<p>CGNS will eventually eliminate most of the "translator"
programs now necessary when working between machines
and between CFD codes.  Also, it eventually may allow for the
results from one code to be easily restarted using another
code.  It will hopefully therefore save a lot of time (and
money).  In particular, it is hoped that future grid-generation
packages will generate grids WITH ALL CONNECTIVITY AND BC
INFORMATION INCLUDED as part of a CGNS file, saving a lot
of time and avoiding potential costly errors in setting
up this information after-the-fact.

<p><strong><a href="#top">Return To Top</a></strong></p>


<hr>

<p><a NAME="how"><u><strong>HOW CGNS HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED INTO CFL3D:</strong></u>

<p>Basically, what the current implementation of CGNS in CFL3D
means is that the old GRID and RESTART files are now replaced
with one CGNS file.  The input file is unchanged (except for
the filename on line 2, which now refers to the CGNS file rather
than a "standard" grid file).  All old cases that could be run
before with CFL3D should still run with CGNS and give identical
results.

<p>Changes to the original CFL3D code are relatively minimal.
However, extra "high-level" routines that access the CGNS
calls have been added in the file cgnstools.F.  Starting with Version 6.4,
CGNS-related output is no longer mixed in with the standard output file
(cfl3d.out), but is now written to a separate file (cgnsinfo.out).

<p>All of the extra routines required to read and write the CGNS
file utilize the "mid-level library" 
(see <a href="http://www.cgns.org">http://www.cgns.org</a>).
The user is responsible for downloading the CGNS library
directly from the CGNS website and installing it appropriately.
In the CFL3D code, the parameter
"icgns" controls whether CGNS files are used or not.

<p>With CGNS, CFL3D no longer needs to read from or write
to a separate restart file.  However, the input file has
purposefully been kept unchanged (i.e., line 14 of the input file,
which specifies the file name of the restart file when CGNS is not
used, is read in but ignored when CGNS is employed).  For now,
CFL3D still gets the BC's and 1-to-1 information from the standard
input file.  (This information is also put in the CGNS file,
although it is not used by CFL3D.)  It is assumed that in the
future, one may desire to read these items from the CGNS file, and
shorten the standard input file.  But we have deferred this for now.

<p>Some advantages to the fact that the restart file is a CGNS file 
are:</br>
<ul>
<li type=circle>There is only one file to keep track of, valid for both 
restarting and for postprocessing.</li>
<li type=circle>EVERYTHING is included in the restart file, and all
quantities are very well-described, so there is no more worrying about what
has been written to the PLOT3D file.</li>
<li type=circle>If you use the input parameter <strong>iwrest</strong> to write out the
restart file every so often, you can easily plot the CGNS restart
file as the code is running, to keep track of how the solution is 
going.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, with CGNS, some day all that user will need is the CGNS file
to get anything and everything he/she wants, from restarting
to postprocessing.  In fact, many commercial postprocessors already
support CGNS files.  However, CFL3D
still prints out the "usual" PLOT3D-type files, in case they
are needed, as well as other auxiliary files (like cfl3d.res,
cfl3d.out, etc.) that are normally printed out.  But, really,
EVERYTHING is contained in the CGNS file!  This is particularly
useful because (a) all flow solution variables and turbulence
information is in one file, and (b) if you want to keep track of 
your solution's progress as it is running, you can use the 
<strong>iwrest</strong> parameter to write out the CGNS file (=restart file)
periodically and look at it via a postprocessor.

<p>The user is encouraged to obtain the CGNS file viewer
"adfviewer" (available from the CGNS website).  It is very easy
to use and should be self-explanatory.

<p>Note that when CFL3D is run with mesh sequencing, AND IS STOPPED
AT A LEVEL LOWER THAN THE FINEST GRID, there is no easy way to
handle this with CGNS, since the CGNS file contains the FINE grid
only.  With "standard" CFL3D, the restart file would contain the
coarser grid and solution only.  With CGNS, it was decided to write
out the coarse-grid FlowSolution ON THE FINE GRID, with data
repeated in neighboring cells.  Hence, if you plot the solution,
it will be identical to the coarse grid solution, only all the
fine-grid gridpoints will be used.  A node called "Information"
under "FlowSolution" says something like:
             Every-2nd-cell solution (1 level down)

<p>Note that PATCHING and OVERSET
information have not yet been included in the CGNS-part of CFL3D.
I.e., the CGNS files are purposefully missing this information.
The user can still run patched and overset cases with CGNS,
but the patched/overset connectivity information (which is
created by ronnie/maggie and placed in separate binary files)
is never put into the CGNS file itself.  This is similar to
the "normal" mode of running CFL3D.  In the "normal" mode,
the user must have available a grid file, restart file,
patched-info file, and overset-info file when running with
patched/overset.  With CGNS, the user must have available a
CGNS file, patched-info file, and overset-info file.

<p>Also, the "IMOVIE" option currently writes out multiple-time
flowfield information to the plot3d file only, and not to the CGNS
file. Similarly, when using <strong>iteravg</strong> to compute a running
long-time-average of the solution, this is currently only written
to the plot3d files cfl3d_avgg.p3d and cfl3d_avgq.p3d, and not
to the CGNS file.

<p>Also note that when using a CGNS grid file, <strong>NGRID</strong> 
(whose sign usually determines whether a grid of type CFL3D or 
PLOT3D is being read) in the CFL3D input file can be 
either + or -; i.e., its sign is irrelevant.

<p>Finally, CFL3D currently writes out solution information to
the CGNS file both at CELL CENTERS as well as within one rind cell
at all boundaries.  This is necessary in the long-term so that
plotting packages will be able to extract correct BOUNDARY data
(e.g., velocity=0 on solid surfaces) from the CGNS file.  However,
note that at the current time the BCs are not updated immediately
prior to writing out the CGNS file, so the rind cells are "behind"
by one iteration; this can mean "imperfect" matching at interfaces
or slightly non-zero velocities on solid surfaces when plotting
from the CGNS file, particularly if the solution is far from
convergence.

<p><a NAME="try"><u><strong>HOW TO TRY CGNS:</strong></u>

<ul>
<li type=circle>STEP 1: Go to <a href="http://www.cgns.org">http://www.cgns.org</a>
and download the latest version of CGNS.</li>
<li type=circle>STEP 2: Compile CGNS on your system by following CGNS's
instructions.</li>
<li type=circle>STEP 3: Compile (or re-compile) CFL3D using<br>
./Install -cgnsdir=dir2<br>
where dir2 is your location for your CGNS directory.</li>
<li type=circle>STEP 4a: If you do not already have a CGNS grid, then perform
this step to create one. Type "make cfl3d_tools."
Then use the code <strong>plot3dg_to_cgns</strong> (in Tools/)
to translate your PLOT3D-type or CFL3D-type grid to a CGNS grid
(you must also have available the corresponding CFL3D input file).</li>
<li type=circle>STEP 4b: If you already have a CGNS grid, then you must create a CFL3D input file.
Use the code <strong>cgns_to_cfl3dinput</strong> (in Tools/)
to read the CGNS file and create a first-guess skeleton input file with most of the needed relevant
information in it.</li>
<li type=circle>STEP 5: Make the CFL3D code ("make cfl3d_mpi" or "make cfl3d_seq").</li>
<li type=circle>STEP 6: Be sure your CFL3D input file has: (a) replaced the gridfile
name in line 1 with the CGNS filename you want to use, and (b) added the keyword
"icgns 1". Note that there is no longer a restart.bin
file written (it is still in the input file, but it is not used... the
CGNS file now has all the restart information in it).</li>

<p><a NAME="aux"><u><strong>AUXILIARY PROGRAMS:</strong></u>

<p>Three auxiliary programs are currently available in CFL3D's "Tools" directory.
These programs are all you need to get started using CGNS!

<pre>
plot3dg_to_cgns.F............program to convert a "standard" grid
                             file to a CGNS grid file (also needs
                             to read CFL3D input file in order to
                             capture BC and 1-to-1 connectivity info)

cgns_to_cfl3dinput.F.........program to read an existing CGNS file
                             and create a first-guess skeleton CFL3D
                             input file with most of the needed 
                             relevant information in it

cgns_readhist.F..............program to read an existing CGNS file
                             and write out its convergence history
                             information to a separate formatted file
</pre>

<p><strong><a href="#top">Return To Top</a></strong></p>


<hr>

<p><a NAME="diff"><u><strong>WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES CGNS MAKE?</strong></u>

<p>Notice, in running CFL3D under CGNS, there is now only ONE
file (the CGNS file) rather than TWO (grid+restart).  This
CGNS file contains the grid and the solution.  It is used for
restarting, and, if you have a CGNS-compatable postprocessor,
for visualizing as well.  (Note:  if you are using a LINK or
LINKS within your CGNS file, then more than one CGNS files are
needed).

<p>The CGNS file is A MACHINE-INDEPENDENT file.  You can port
this file to any machine anywhere, and any code that is
CGNS-compliant will be able to read it.

<p>So now you can easily run CFL3D on different machines and
transfer the grids and solutions back and forth without need for
special translators.  You can also run a case and send the resulting
CGNS file to a fellow engineer across the country (who has a
CGNS-compatable postprocessor), and they will be able to easily
view it, without worry about what machine it ran on.  In the
future, as more and more CFD codes become CGNS-compliant, it will
be easier to restart solutions from one code to another.


<hr>

<p><a NAME="problems"><u><strong>KNOWN PROBLEMS</strong></u>

<ul>
<li type=circle>Problems can sometimes occur when using LINKS within
CGNS files (a link is useful if you wish to keep the
GridCoordinates in a separate CGNS file from the solution).
Links seem to work as long as you always work on the same
machine where the link was created, but you currently cannot,
for example, create a linked CGNS file on a machine of one
type then use it on a different one (e.g., SGI --> CRAY or
vice versa).  Another problem is that currently the file
you link to MUST have read-write permission (it cannot be
read-only).</li>
